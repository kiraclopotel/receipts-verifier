// observations.mjs: the served observations out of an export, with no model reading in them.
//
// Copyright 2026 FeelingWise. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0;
// see the LICENSE file beside this one.
//
// Usage:  node observations.mjs <export.html|export.json> [--json] [--out file]
// Exit:   0 a projection was written, 2 the file held no observation to project,
//         3 the file could not be read.
//
// WHY, and it is a real limit of the format rather than a preference.
//
// A record carries two different kinds of thing. "This text was served at this
// time, in this surface, by this account" is an observation. "This is a fear
// appeal at severity 5" is a reading, by a named model, at a stated confidence.
// The first is a fact about the world. The second is the output of a model
// whose behaviour changes between releases, so nobody doing measurement can
// cite it and expect the number to mean the same thing next year.
//
// This writes out the first kind and nothing else. Every field naming a model,
// a score, a technique, a verdict or a rewrite is left out. What each row keeps
// is its `integrityHash` and its position, so any row can be found again in the
// signed file it came from.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a signed artefact and it is not evidence on its
// own. The signed export is the evidence; this is a projection of it that
// anybody can reproduce by running this tool over the same file, which is the
// property that makes it citeable. Name the source file and its SHA-256 beside
// any table built from it; the header this tool writes gives you both.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A SIGNED EXPORT WITH THE READINGS REMOVED, which is what an
// earlier plan in this project called for and priced at half a day. That plan
// was wrong and the reason is worth keeping. A record's signature covers a hash
// of ALL its fields together, readings included, so removing a field makes the
// hash unrecomputable. The format does have a mechanism for exactly that, the
// signed redaction marker, and it does not fit here for two reasons: a marker
// binds to ONE record, so an export of 130,000 records would need 130,000 more
// records to say what was withheld; and the alternative, a new file-wide
// declaration, would be a format change that every already-published copy of
// verify-export.mjs would reject. Handing a researcher a file that our own
// published checker calls broken is worse than handing them a projection.

// ── What counts as an observation ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The list is deliberately SHORT and the rule for adding to it is: a field goes
// in only when it describes what the platform served, when, or where. Anything
// that describes what this product concluded stays out, and where a field could
// be read either way it stays out, because a projection that quietly carries a
// judgement is worse than one that is missing a column somebody wanted.
//
// Left out on purpose, with the reason, so nobody has to guess whether it was
// forgotten:
//   neutralizedText  the model's rewrite. The most obviously a reading.
//   techniques, overallScore, harmFloor, topic, sourceCategory
//                    what the reading concluded and how strongly.
//   aiModel, aiProvider, aiSource, reader
//                    which model read it. Useful, and it belongs beside a
//                    reading, not beside an observation.
//   verdict, decision, detectionMode, verdictOrigin, overrideOrigin,
//   visualApplied, skipReason, failureKind, cap, metrics
//                    what this product DID about the item. That is a fact, and
//                    it is a fact about the product rather than about the feed,
//                    so it is not what this file is for.
//   imageContext, videoContext
//                    model output about media.

 * it is a pathological case and the vectors exist because pathological cases are
 * what two implementations disagree about.
 *
 * C0 CONTROL CHARACTERS other than tab and newline are written into the CSV as
 * they stand. RFC 4180 does not allow them and some readers will mangle them.
 * They are NOT escaped, on purpose: escaping would mean the text in the file no
 * longer hashes to the identity printed beside it, and that property is worth
 * more than conformance for a file this rare. `--json` is the lossless form and
 * the header says so when a file needs it.
 *
 * AN UNPAIRED SURROGATE cannot be encoded as UTF-8 at all, so it is written as
 * U+FFFD. That is not a loss of agreement: the identity rule encodes to UTF-8
 * too, so the record's text and the printed text produce the SAME identity. It
 * is a loss of the character, and the header says so rather than leaving a
